# **Budgetmanager**

**How ?**

The idea from Budgetmanager was born after a meeting with my manager.
Nowadays, he use several tools to report activity and 
and therefore loses productivity. 

**What can I do with this ?**

Budgetmanager is "plug & play" app, you log in with your SG account and then you have access to various features.
With this application, you can make reports, manage your expense/resources/applications easely.
